Hello everyone! 

This is my first writeup ever, so I hope you enjoy it. I will try to explain everything as clear as possible, but if you have any questions, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariooo_02).

DIFICULTY: **Hard**

## Task 1: Get the QR Code of the room

In order to access to this room, you first need to find 4 different parts of a QR code which are hidden in the official
social media accounts of TryHackMe.

- FIRST QR CODE: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RealTryHackMe/status/1730184898365767880)

![QR_PART_1](/_writeups/images/twitter-qr-part.png)

- SECOND QR CODE: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tryhackme_can-you-help-elf-mcskidy-and-her-team-tackle-activity-7135598321280188416-5wnQ)

![QR_PART_2](/_writeups/images/linkedin-qr-part.png)


- THIRD QR CODE: [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/521382216299839518/1176552309707264041/1179095411420577943)

![QR_PART_3](/_writeups/images/discord-qr-part.png)

- FOURTH QR CODE: [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber23sidequest)

![QR_PART_4](/_writeups/images/thm-qr-part.png)

The last qr code is given by the TryHackMe team in the last part of the Side Quest Room.

In my case, I didn't find the Discord QR code part, so I searched in Google how to complete a QR code with the other 3 parts and I found this [website](https://merri.cx/qrazybox/) called QrazyBox, which is very useful for this kind of things, but you need to know the basics of how a QR code works.

The final QR code is the following:

## Task 2: Pcap Analysis

Once you have the QR code, you can access to the room. The three first questions are easy to answer if you have some knowledge about the basics of networking and how to use Wireshark.

We just need to open the pcap file with Wireshark and we will find a broadcast message with the following **SSID**:

![SSID](/_writeups/images/first-answer.png)

**What's the name of the WiFi network in the PCAP?**

> ANSWER: FreeWifiBFC

The protocol used in the broadcast communication is **IEE 802.11**. To decrypt the traffic we just need to provide the password, which can be extracted from the handshake that contains the password hashed.

We can use [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cracking_wpawpa2) with the 22000 mode and the rockyou.txt wordlist to crack the password:

```bash

hashcat -m 22000 vanSpy.hcaapx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

```

![HASHCAT](/_writeups/images/second-answer.png)

**What's the password to access the WiFi network?**

> ANSWER: Christmas

Now we need to add the password to the Wireshark preferences and we will be able to decode the traffic.

![IEEE](/_writeups/images/IEE-password.png)
![IEEE-2](/_writeups/images/IEEE-password-2.png)

The traffic is now partially decrypted. At this point, we can use a hint given in the "Yeti Speaks" section of the room where it was said that "Van Spy had planted a backdoor". The common port of a backdoor is **4444**, so if we search by `tcp.port == 4444` we will find the following traffic:

![BACKDOOR](/_writeups/images/length-packet.png)

If we follow the TCP stream, we will find the following message:

![BACKDOOR-2](/_writeups/images/mimikatz.png)

**What suspicious tool is used by the attacker to extract a juicy file from the server?**

> ANSWER: mimikatz

---

## Task 3: The PFX File

At the end of the message, we can see that the attaker used the powershell to read the contents of a **PFX** file and convert it to a based64 string.

This type of file is also known as **PKCS #12** and it is used to store private keys with their X.509 certificate chains. It stands for Personal Information Exchange File. 

It includes the following information:

- Private key associated with the certificate, used in order to decrypt the information encrypted with the public key.

- Public keey associated with the certificate.

- Certificate chain, which is a list of certificates that are used to authenticate the certificate associated with the private key.

![PFX](/_writeups/images/pfx-file.png)

We can use the decrypted content of the PFX file to decrypt the TLS traffic of the pcap file. 

![decrypted](/_writeups/images/privkey-pfx.png)

We just need to go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> TLS` and add the private key and the certificate chain to the SSL section.

![TLS](/_writeups/images/tls-decrypt.png)

Now we need to save the decrypted traffic as a new pcap file and open it with Wireshark.

## Task 3: PyRDP

There is a tool called [PyRDP](https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp) that can be used for Man-in-the-Middle attacks against RDP connections. 

Before using it, we firstly need to convert the pcap file to a replay file (`.pyrdp`) using the `pyrdp-convert` function:

```bash
pyrdp-convert -f replay.pyrdp rpd.pcap
```

And then we can use the `pyrdp-player` to replay the intercepted traffic within RDP:

```bash

pyrdp-player -f replay.pyrdp

```

![RDP-player](/_writeups/images/pyrdp-player.png)

Executing the command above, we will be able to see the video of the RDP connection that provides us the answer to the last two questions.
